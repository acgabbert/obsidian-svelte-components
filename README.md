# obsidian-utils [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/obsidian-svelte-components.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/obsidian-svelte-components)
This is a library I've built for adding Svelte components to Obsidian plugins. 

This library is expected to change frequently. My future goal is to improve test coverage and get the code to a more stable state before releasing version 1.0.
